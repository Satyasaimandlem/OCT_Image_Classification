# OCT_Image_Classification Of Drusen, DME and CNV

Introduction:

The human eye is a complex organ responsible for vision, composed of several parts that work together to capture and process light. The main components of the eye include the cornea, iris, pupil, lens, retina, and optic nerve.
The retina is a crucial part of the eye located at the back, containing light-sensitive cells called photoreceptors that convert light into electrical signals. The macula is a small area in the center of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision, essential for activities like reading and driving.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a powerful imaging technique used to capture detailed, cross-sectional images of the retina. These images provide valuable information for diagnosing and monitoring eye conditions such as drusen, diabetic macular edema (DME), and choroidal neovascularization (CNV).
1. Drusen are small yellow deposits that form under the retina, particularly in the macula. OCT images can clearly show the presence of drusen, helping eye care professionals diagnose age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss in older adults.
2. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a complication of diabetic retinopathy, a condition that affects people with diabetes. OCT is crucial in diagnosing DME as it can visualize the swelling (edema) in the macula caused by fluid leakage from blood vessels.
3. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a condition where abnormal blood vessels grow beneath the retina. OCT imaging can detect CNV by revealing the presence of these abnormal vessels and any associated fluid or blood leakage.
In summary, OCT plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of eye conditions such as drusen, DME, and CNV. By providing detailed images of the retina, OCT helps eye care professionals accurately diagnose these conditions and develop appropriate treatment plans to preserve vision.
